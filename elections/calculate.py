# STV Election Tabulation
##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Each ballot is stored as a list of candidate ids, ordered by the rank the
# voter has assigned the candidate. Instead of working with individual ballots
# during calculations, this algorithm creates a tree structure that represents
# possible ways of voting and how many people voted in that particular way.
#
# Each node will have a count and candidate associated with it. It will also
# have a dictionary of child nodes, each of which represent the count of voters
# who chose a particular candidate as their next choice.
#
# In the process of keeping track of ballots, we can just merge different trees.
