  HOT DAMN!
  It's been almost a year since I started doing the sin thing with JM.
  I would not have been able to do this 10 months ago. No way no how.
  The first re-do of SIN was okay, but still very clunky. 
  ---
  I think it's about time we threw off the shackles of Reed-branding.
  Now, I'm going for a bit more of a minimal design.
  ---
  This new template is supposed to be my gift to posterity. 
  It's documented on the new wiki: 
    [[ if there isn't a link here it means i forgot to add it or there aren't docs hahahaaaaa ]]
  ---
  If you are going to redesign SIN in some capacity
  (I very highly suggest doing so- tt's a terrific, albeit frustrating, exercise),
  I only ask that you please preserve these templates.
  ---
  That's all.

  With love,

    *** IMPORTANT *** 
    *** Modifying the javascript blocks WILL BREAK THINGS. Everywhere.***
    -- There are three blocks for including extra javascript here:
    -- [1] on-load
           this is to preserve on-load events from earlier templates
           I'll hopefully document all of its uses on the wiki
    -- [2] raw-javascript
           This is a block for adding additional javascript-- WITHOUT SCRIPT TAGS
           This seriously needs to be phased out because it's redundant
           Let's go ahead and call it deprecated??
           I've seen it in use in the org-manager app, finance app, ...
    -- [3] src-javascript
           This is a block for adding additional javascript source files
    Documentation is also on the wiki.

	        wmd_poi();             // get it?!?!     flips the flame

     Another legacy block below ("fancy-header").
     This one actually is in use for most templates.
     Hooray for backwards compatibility!

  side-bar is pretty hefty, so it's an include.

  NOTE about the side-bar:
  -- If the hacky jQuery thing that adds an active class (see above: $(document).ready...) is not working,
  -- try putting blocks in each link-class. It's a total pain, I know,
  -- but that's the price to pay for a dynamic nav bar.
{% endcomment %}
<div class="big-wrap">
{% include "includes/side-bar.html" %}
{% comment %}
  Lastly, here's where the content goes! (in ".main")
  Check the wiki for some explanation of what's going on here.
  IMPORTANT!
  -- You need to wrap each collection of 12 columns in a DIV of class "row".
     This is a hack to fix some funkiness with how columns were spacing/collapsing
     relative to the side-bar. I'm not sure if it's 100% solid. Godspeed.
  -- I have had best results with "md" sized columns.
  -- Remember to check the wiki for a better explanation of the "hide-bar" class if that's confusing you

  So, the following is a legacy block. 
  No clue if anything depends on it so I kept it in.
  Should be deprecated!!!
