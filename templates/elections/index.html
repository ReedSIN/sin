<p><b>*</b><i>When this bar is green, it means that over a quarter of the student
        body population has voted. If less than a 1/4 of the SB population doesn't
        vote, then the election automatically doesn't reach quorum. Of course,
        people can vote no quorum, so a green bar is no guarentee of quorum.</i></p>
