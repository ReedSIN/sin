  <h2 class="featurette heading">Wait, What is Funding Poll?</h2>
    <p>There are a few different ways of viewing Funding Poll. From a functional standpoint, it is a way for
the Student Government to dole out money to groups of students in a fair manner, via democracy.
On the other hand, from a more philosophical standpoint, Funding Poll is an expression of the state of 
the Student Body as a whole in terms of interests, maturity, and cohesiveness. But enough with that, all
you <span style="text-style: italics;">really</span> need to ask yourself is the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do I have a totally awesome idea that my peers will like, support, and (more importantly) vote for?
  <li>Is my idea actually feasible in all of its awesomeness?</li>
  <li>Will this idea be made more amazing with some hard cash on hand?</li>
</ol>
Thats it. If your idea fits those three categories, you should attend Signator Training and register your brainchild for funding poll. 
Money is not the key to life, but it does make doing awesome things much easier. And that is really what 
the Student Government is really trying to do here, empower us, the student body of Reed College, 
to do totally awesome things. After all, my friends, we do these things not because they are easy, but because they are FRIGGIN SWEET.</p>

<h2>How does Funding Poll Work?</h2>
<p>
Funding Poll serves as a barometer of student priorities for use of student funds, and
helps determine that use. The "Top 40" organizations which get the highest level of
student support get to present budgets to Senate immediately afterwards, in the same
order (though any organization, including Top 40 orgs, can come to Finance Committee to
ask for funds later).
</p>

<p>
The Funding Poll scoring system works as follows:
<ol><li>Top 6 (+8)</li>
<li>Approve (+2)</li>
<li>No Opinion (0)</li>
<li>Disapprove (-1)</li>
<li>Deep 6 (-4)</li>
</ol>
</p>
</div> <!-- /.col-md-12 -->
</div> <!-- /.row -->

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>
As you can see, the scoring system encourages you to offer positive input over negative
input, and the terms "Top 6" and "Deep 6" do not refer to the number of points added or
subtracted. Rather, they refer to the fact that the absolute greatest number of times you
can use them is six (6). For example, if you Top 6 five organizations, you can only Deep 6
one. Use your Top 6 &amp; Deep 6 votes wisely.

Happy voting! This is a pretty neat system we have; let's make sure everyone makes use
of it. Rest assured: despite the $40K poll tax (it's hard work we do here at SIN), this is one
election the Supreme Court won't be deciding for us.
