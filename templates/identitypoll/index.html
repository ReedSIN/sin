    <h2>What is the identity based funding poll?</h2>
    <p>
      The Student Senate of the Autonomous Student Body of Reed College recognizes that students may face institutional barriers at Reed or in America that prevent equal access to services, aid, and opportunities on the basis of identity. The purpose of this funding pool is to finance the work of student groups that support communities that are historically marginalized at Reed or in the nation at large. These include communities that share a racial, ethnic, cultural, religious, or other historically marginalized identity. In recognizing this, we hope to guarantee a financial baseline for student organizations that aims to offer support for these disadvantaged students as a means of building community and providing resources that are otherwise insufficient or absent at Reed.
